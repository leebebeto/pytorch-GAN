Weather delays at Hazeltine meant the second round ran into Saturday, and on the par-four 18th, Woods hooked his drive into the left fairway bunker.The ball settled near the left lip, and standing in the sand, he was closer to the ball than usual.But instead of chipping out, he reached for the flat, unforgiving blade of a 3-iron, hoisting it high over trees to find the green.  "The wind was blowing about 25-30 mph off the left," added Woods. "The lip was in front of me, trees were in front of me, [I had a] downhill lie and somehow I hit it -- I don't know how I hit it that solid, that clean, that flush and drew it up against the wind and held it, landed about 20ft away."READ: What would Tiger say to his younger self?READ: What makes Tiger Woods' perfect day?READ: Tiger Woods -- The glory and the painREAD: What makes Jason Day's perfect day?His playing partner Ernie Els looked on in admiration.
